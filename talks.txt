A= 玩家； B=Boss;

A: How did we end up here, sitting like this?
B: It’s the 37th time that you’ve asked this same question.
A: ……..
B: Let me remind you again, you ran out of ammunition.
A: So do you.
B: And you cannot deal any substantial damage to me with your melee attack.
A: We both can’t.
B: Next, you are going to ask that how long have we been here.
A: How long have we been here?
B: Objectively, xxx seconds. Subjectively, you know it better than me. 
(xxx是个计数变量，取整数，从游戏开始按下start的一刻开始计时)
A: Fine, what do we do now?
B: 11st time of this one. How about a cup of tea this time?
A: Agree.

茶壶和茶杯此时fade in， 正篇开始，今后玩家回合选项增加一个”x to tea” 
（之前都只有z to talk的选项）



Module 1:
B: Why were you trying to kill me ?
A: That is one of the things I cannot recall.
B: Cannot recall the reason? Or the fact that you managed to kill me?
A: Both.
B: Amnesia is an useful trait.


Module 2:
B: Let’s change a topic.
A: What’s the purpose of this conversation?
B: To sustain this embarrassing equilibrium, make our current existence meaningful.


Module 3:
B: Do you have or believe in free will?
A: This me, or the me that is controlling this me?
B: Either.
A: I wanted to.
B: We reached a common ground on this one.


Module 4:
B: An objective of murdering me, was it driven by revenge, desire for attention, instinct, or just a sheer “objective”?
A: It doesn’t matter now.
B: Is that what made you exist?
A: Or the other way around?
B: It doesn’t matter, now.


Module 5:
B: I wonder, what you usually do when you are not killing ?
A: I play video games.
B: And keep killing in the games you play?
A: No, I like to play games that focus on dialogue.
B: Interesting choice, isn’t that what we’re doing now?
A: So, what you usually do when not fighting off players?
B: I practice my social skills.
A: In front of a mirror?  
B: By talking to myself.


Module 6:
B: I don't feel like talking for a while.


Module 7:
B: Honestly, I also start doubting the point of this pointless conversation now.
A: I figured that it is some sort of filler to fill up this tea session.
B: You ain’t gonna say nothing during a tea session, right? 
A: Indeed.
B: Let’s continue.


Module 8:
B: I’m dreadful of what would happen when I depleted my dialogue pool.
A: Translate your last phrase.
B: When I got nothing else to say.
A: You can still repeat what you have already said.
B: Good strategy, will do.


Module 9:
B: How could people with confrontational ideologies like us still sit together peacefully and have tea?
A: Can we don’t talk about ideology? 
B: I'm bored of that as well. I am talking about the state of our existence.
A: The only reason we are having this discussion is because there is nothing else we could do at this state.
B: You finally start to realize that.


Module 10:
B: Feel like I am starting to enjoy this conversation now.
A: I almost feel the same, better than have nothing to do.
B: A toast to the tea.


Module 11:
B: What is the thing you're most afraid of?
A: Normally, that is the last thing I want to tell you.
B: Hmm… Still so vigilant, I can understand your worries. However, I suppose we both agree that we’re not any close to a “normal” state at this moment.
A: You made your point.
B: To show you my sincerity, my deepest phobia is having audience whom do not understand me.
A: I see, then mine is to make decision.
B: Luckily, you don’t have many options to choose among now.


Module 12:
B: Let's talk about something neutral, like what’s your opinion on video games?
A: That’s too broad a question for me to give a succinct answer, make it more precise.
B: What‘s your opinion on video games that with very limited room for players.
A: Still, this topic is as vague as the discussion of free will. How about name an instance?
B: What’s your opinion on video games where the players are only being provided with binary choices all the time? 
A: You are making it even vaguer, can’t the whole universe be summarized this way?
B: How do you like a game where you are portrayed as the protagonist, the Player 1?
A: I don't want to talk about this anymore.
B: Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.


Module 13:
B: Have you ever wondered how everything will end up here?
A: First, what has been concluded in this “everything”?
B: This conversation, this tea session, this equilibrium between us, everything.
A: It’s none of my concern, plus, I don’t think our concern could change any of this. You should have known this much better than me.
B: True, and that’s why I’m asking. For you are the only variable in this whole enclosed system.
A: Is that a request of cooperation? Or should I say, a request for help?
B: Neither, it’s just merely a reminder. As your former objective became void, don’t you feel the urge of obtaining a new one?
A: I thought they already had one.
B: Well then.


Module 14:
B: Have I said this before?
A: I don’t think so, it also doesn’t matter that much.
B: Fine, let’s skip this one.


Module 15:
B: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
A: Phasellus venenatis nisi non interdum efficitur.
B: Vestibulum ut sapien hendrerit, dignissim ante sit amet, tempus nunc.
A: Quisque tincidunt nisl ac mauris porttitor, ut aliquet enim sollicitudin.
B: Phasellus aliquam nisi id quam bibendum mollis.


Module 16:
B: Have you spotted how hard had I tried to maintain this conversation, to properly organize each of these topics and sentences?
A: I do, and I appreciate your effort.
B: It just getting harder and harder.


Module 17:
B: This might sounds cliché, but, have we met each other before?
A: As far as I can recall, no. But I do really hope so, at least it could bring more sense into this dilemma.
B: I am afraid it will only bring in more absurdity.


Module 18:
B: What are you planning to do when it’s over?
A: You mean all this? Are you sure it will ever be over?
B: I believe so, but don’t take this as a guarantee.
A: I’m going to play a hell lot of video games.
B: Bon appétit.



Module 19:
B: How are you?
A: Fine, except the tea could have been better. Actually, this is one of few questions I could never figure out how to answer properly.
B: Let me show you a demonstration, I have practiced this a lot.
A: How are you?
B: 4 out of 5.


Module 20:
B: What does it feels like to be a player controlled character in video games?
A: Is this some kind of interview or press conference? If so, this one still went too far even in those standards.
B: I would consider it more of a consultation. Just a personal curiosity of mine, for it is such a concept that I could never ever comprehend.  
A: Quote: “All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players”.
B: True, we all got our roles to play.
